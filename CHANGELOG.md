       to get started playing around with the library. See [`docs/usage.md`](/docs/usage.md)
       for more.
* MOD: Disable TileAnimation pre-loading. Automatically pre-loading all tile layers was causing
       significant performance issues when creating several TileAnimations at once.
       An interface for manually pre-loading animations is slated for a future release of Aeris.js.
       See code snippet below for a temporary pre-loading solution.
* MOD: TileAnimation and AnimationSync no longer changes the from/to bounds of the animation when
       new times are loaded. See code snippet below to restore the previous behavior.
* MOD: aeris.api.collections.Lightning sorts models by date/time. This results in a more geographically
       distributed collection (by default, Aeris API sorts Lightning by distance).
* FIX: Fix parsing of collection data for models which dynamically generate ids.
* FIX: Configure styles for all point data marker clusters.
* FIX: Remove invalid BatchModel documentation.
* FIX: When an animation is set to the current actual time,
       never display a forecast tile layer. (Previously, the animation
       would should either a past or a future layer, depending on whichever
       layer's time was closer to the current time).

See git history for a full list of changes.



### Temporary Solution For Pre-loading Animations

```js
var animation = new aeris.interactive.animations.TileAnimation(layer);

animation.on('load:times', function(times) {
  var currentTime = animation.getCurrentTime();

  // Calling goToTime will trigger the time layer to load.
  times.forEach(function(time) {
    animation.goToTime(time);
  });

  // Revert back to the original time
  animation.goToTime(currentTime);
});
```


### Update animation from/to times when times are loaded

```js
var animation = new aeris.interactive.animations.TileAnimation(layer);

animation.on('load:times', function(times) {
  var earliestTime = Math.min.apply(Math, times);
  var latestTime = Math.max.apply(Math, times);

  animation.setFrom(earliestTime);
  animation.setTo(latestTime);
});
```


# 0.7.7

* ADD: Precip tile layer
* ADD: Support future (forecast) tiles and animation for for Radar, Precip, Satellite, SatelliteGlobal, and Winds
* ADD: Map `scrollZoom` attribute. Allows disabling scroll-to-zoom functionality (Google Maps, Leaflet)
* ADD: Model for /places Aeris API endpoint (`aeris.api.models.Place`, `aeris.api.collections.Places`)
* MOD: AerisApiModel/Collection: Promise returned by `fetch()` is now resolved with an ApiResponseError object.
* MOD: Api object params: accept strings as from/to params (eg. 'today', 'tomorrow')

See git history for a full list of changes.

# 0.7.5

* FIX: Bug fix: MarkerCollection markers adding before setting the object to a map
       were not being rendered (Leaflet only)
* FIX: Include marker cluster icon styles inline (Leaflet), or injected into the DOM (gmaps)

       to stop playing, in some cases.

See git history for a full list of changes.

# 0.7.3

* FIX: Prevent aeris.util from overriding underscore object.
       This fixes issues with clients' underscore templates not
       properly compiling, and prevents custom Aeris.js utlity functions
       from leaking into other users code.

**BREAKING CHANGES**

* MOD: Update animation examples

See git history for a full list of changes

### Notes on upgrading to Aeris.js v0.6.0

##### Animations
You can now control an animation using the layer with which it was created. For example:

```javascript
var map = new aeris.maps.Map('map-canvas');
var radar = new aeris.maps.layers.Radar();
var animation = new aeris.maps.animations.TileAnimation(radar);

animation.start();

// animation.setOpacity(0.5);     // this no longer works in v0.6.0

radar.setOpacity(0.5);            // use this instead
radar.setMap(null);               // Removes the animated layer from the map
radar.setMap(map);                // Adds the animated back to the map
```

The same works for AnimationSync objects

```javascript
var map = new aeris.maps.Map('map-canvas');
var radar = new aeris.maps.layers.Radar();
var satellite = new aeris.maps.layers.Satellite();
var animation = new aeris.maps.animations.AnimationSync([radar, satellite]);

radar.setMap(map);
satellite.setMap(map);
animation.start();

radar.setOpacity(0.5);    // Changes the opacity of the radar layer only
                          // (note that this was not possible in v0.5)

radar.setMap(null);       // Removes the radar layer from the map
```

The goal of this change is to better decouple the animation object from the layer objects. Previously, if a layer was being animated, you could not manipulate the base layer without messing up the animation. Now, you can use the base layer the same as before it was animated, and all animation frames will follow suit.


##### requestView

The `requestView` method has been removed from all mapObjects. It was previously recommended to use `mapObject.requestView()` (asynchronous, returns promise) in place of `mapObject.getView()` (synchronous, returns view) because some map objects loaded their view-rendering strategy asynchronously. In v0.6.0, the StrategyObject has been refactored to only load strategies synchronously.

When upgrading to v0.6.0, you will need to replace all calls to `requestView` with calls to `getView`. For example:

```javascript
// In v0.5
mapObject.requestView().
  done(function(view) {
    var mapObjectView = view;
  });


// In v0.6
var mapObjectView = mapObject.getView();
```

# 0.5.1

* MOD: Update demos to use Leaflet,
       or use aeris-gmaps build when not a features are supported.
* ADD: aeris.Model#bindAttributesTo method
* FIX: Use noConflict on underscore
* FIX: Strategy object remove rendered map object view
       on destroy
* FIX: Leaflet strategies clean up view event listeners on destroy.

SEe git history for a full list of changes.

# 0.5.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**

* MOD: Renamed built library files, using an 'aeris-` prefix.
       eg. 'aeris-gmaps.js' instead of 'gmaps.js'
* MOD: Default aeris.js not uses Leaflet, instead of gmaps.

To adapt to breaking changes, make sure you update your links to the Aeris.js library.
If you currently using Google Maps along with the main 'aeris.js' or 'aeris.min.js'
script, you will want to switch to use 'aeris-gmaps.js' or 'aeris-gmaps.min.js'.

# 0.4.3

* ADD: Batch api requests with AerisBatchModel
       see [docs](docs/usage.md#batch-requests) for details
* ADD: AerisApiModel/AerisApiCollection `getAction` and `getEndpoint` methods.
* ADD: Params accept array for 'filter' option.
       (previously only accepted a FilterCollection)
* ADD: AnimationSync accepts an array of layers for `add` and as
       constructor argument.
* MOD: Params do not proxy change events for the nested ChainedQuery
       collection if the query instance is changed.
       (removed bloated code which provided little value, and no documented use)
* MOD: TileAnimations default 'frame' limit set to 10
       (instead of unlimited). Results in faster load time, by default.
       Note: you can set the TileAnimation 'limit' option to null to
       revert to unlimited animation frames.
